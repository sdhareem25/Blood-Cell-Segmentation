# Blood-Cell-Segmentation
This project implements blood cell segmentation from microscopic images using classical image processing techniques in OpenCV. The pipeline includes CLAHE-based contrast enhancement, noise reduction, distance transform, and marker-based watershed segmentation to identify and separate blood cells in biomedical images.
